### How much you count
You are an everyday John Doe.

You know a researcher Doe II who spends his life studying populations for risk of heart attack.

You do not want a heart attack.  Fortunately, from your general world knowledge you are low risk.
But, low risk means 1 in 1000 per year, and your risk aversion compels you to be willing to act on yourself to further avoid risk.  How do you do it?

Consult Doe II of course.  Doe II has trained a model to estimate your risk based on risk factors, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, and diabetes.  Doe II suggests you lower your age (not possible), be female (not possible), increase your physical activity, and lower your blood sugar.

You already walk 30 minutes 3 times weekly and your fasting blood sugar level is 70.  You wonder if Doe II's model really applies to you. 

Doe II's model was a survival model built on the general population.
