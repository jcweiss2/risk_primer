### How much you count
You are an everyday John Doe.

You know a researcher Doe II who spends his life studying populations for risk of heart attack.

You do not want a heart attack.  Fortunately, from your general world knowledge you are low risk.
But, low risk means 1 in 1000 per year, and your risk aversion compels you to be willing to act on yourself to further avoid risk.  How do you do it?

Consult Doe II of course.  Doe II has trained a model to estimate your risk based on risk factors, including age, gender, physical activity, and diabetes.
