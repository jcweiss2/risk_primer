### How much you count
You are an everyday John Doe.

You know a researcher Doe II who spends his life studying populations for risk of heart attack.

You do not want a heart attack.  Fortunately, from your general world knowledge you are low risk.
But, low risk means 1 in 1000 per year, and your risk aversion compels you to be willing to act on yourself to further avoid risk.  How do you do it?

Consult Doe II of course.
